```
#### System should be updated to latest version:
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade -y
```

## Software
#### Reqired System Software Packages
Recommend to use python3.7 environment.
```
sudo apt-get install -y python3.7 python-pip python3.7-tk tk-dev build-essential swig libsm6 libxrender1 libxext-dev
```
pip recommend to be upgraded to latest version:
```
pip install --upgrade pip
```
If this is the 1st time to upgrade pip as normal user, logout and login will be required in order to use the new version **pip** installed in user home directory.

#### Required Python Packages
All required packages with specific versions are listed in file **requirements.txt**, run command to install:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
You can also use virtual environment to setup the working environment, run command to install:
```
sudo apt-get install python3-venv
apt-get install python3.7-dev python3.7-venv
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dataset
Copy all testing fundus image files into one folder, e.g. **./images**. The supported image file format are: png, jpg, or tiff.

# Prediction

## Usage
```
usage: python3.7 main.py --input DATASET_DIR [--output OUTPUT_DIR] [--threshold THRESHOLD_VALUE] [-h]

options:
  --input DATASET_DIR         The input directory for dataset image files, must be specified.
  --output OUTPUT_DIR         The result output csv file directory, optional, default to *./outputs*.
  -h                          Show command line options.

examples:
  git clone https://github.com/SunnyAVT/visually_significant_cataract.git
  cd visually_significant_cataract
  python3 main.py
  python3 main.py --input ./images --output ./outputs 
```

## Result
The prediction result will be shown at the end of the program stdout. The result will be also stored in a file with name **TestResult.csv** in **OUTPUT_DIR**.

## Example
There are 4 sample images under ./images directory for demo purpose:
```
> python3.7 main.py --input ./images --output ./outputs
Using Theano backend.

Cataract Test is Over, Get your results in outputs/TestResult.csv !!!
```
Note: You can replace the images in ./images directory with your test retinal fundus images, then run the same command as above for the AI cataract prediction.

# Trouble shooting
1) Because of the difference in the OS, installation package or running environment, user could encounter error in setup
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
You can use try different packages module version as below.
Such as, you can use tensorflow==1.15 to replace tensorflow==1.14.0
Such as, you can use numpy==1.20.1 to replace numpy==1.19.5

2) Donâ€™t need to care about the warning message in the running, it will not affect the final results. 
The reason is that the code stick to use tensorflow 1.x version in order to compatible with some AI libs.
